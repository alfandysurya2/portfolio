# Welcome to Alfandy Surya's Portfolio Projects

## Overview:
This personal project focuses on data analysis, data science, and data engineering. It involves exploring, analyzing, and deriving insights from a dataset using various data science techniques and tools. Additionally, the project incorporates data engineering aspects to handle data extraction, transformation, and loading processes.

## Project Structure:
The project consists of the following components:

1. **Data**: This folder contains the dataset(s) used in the project. It may include one or more files in formats such as CSV, JSON, or Excel.

2. **Notebooks**: This folder contains Jupyter Notebooks or other code files used for data analysis, modeling, and visualization. Each notebook focuses on a specific aspect of the project and includes detailed explanations and code documentation.

3. **Scripts**: This folder contains Python scripts or other code files that automate data engineering tasks such as data extraction, cleaning, and transformation. These scripts facilitate the efficient processing of large datasets and enable reproducibility.

4. **Reports**: This folder stores any generated reports, summaries, or presentations that communicate the findings and insights obtained from the data analysis process. These reports may be in the form of PDF, Markdown, or PowerPoint files.

5. **README.md**: This file provides an overview of the project, its structure, and instructions on running the code or reproducing the analysis. It also includes relevant information on dependencies, setup, and data sources.

## Dependencies:
To run the code and reproduce the analysis in this project, the following dependencies are required:
